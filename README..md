I like to make lots of lists. Lists of books, movies, life goals, travel
destinations, and so many other random things. At some point the lists grow so
large that it's difficult to actually make decisions based on them, because you
don't know where to start.

priority-finder is a simple program which takes a list of items in a file and
helps you sort them manually using a binary search algorithm.

# Build

    go build -o priority-finder .

# Usage

    ./priority-finder list-file.txt
